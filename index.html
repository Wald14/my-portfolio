      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <P>
        My name is Luke Wald and I'm currently participating in the University of Minnesota's Coding Bootcamp, partnered with edX. 
      </P>
      <p>
        Before starting this bootcamp, I graduated in 2014 with a degree in Biology from St. Johns University, MN and started working for 3M as an "Analytical chemist". In May of 2023, after 9 amazing years, I was laid off. My final title was "Senior Manufacturing Technology Engineer". It was my responsibility to brige the gap between the manufacturing and chemisty worlds. I used chamical analytial tools to solve various code red manufacturing problems, many that involved legacy products.
      </P>
      <p>
        The career change to Full-stack Web Development is both nervwrecking and exciting. A year ago (exactly one year from the start of my bootcamp) I talked with a software engineer about making the career change. I tried the free 'HarvardX CS50 - Intro to Computer Science' course to get my feet wet and see if it's something I'd enjoy. I immediatly fell in love with coding, especially problem solving asspect. In this self-passed course, I was exposed to C, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Currently in the Bootcamp we've learned about HTML, CSS, and Javscript.
