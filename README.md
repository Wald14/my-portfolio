# My Portfolio

## Webpage Description
<div class="fontsizebump"> This is a portfolio that highlights some of my best coding projects for a potential future employeer to review. It is made up of the following sections:</div>

### Header / Navigation
Upon loading the webpage, the viewer is presented with a header that contains the my name, a recent photo, and links to sections on the webpage. These are: "About Me", "Work", and "Contact Me". If the user clicks on the navagation links, the UI will scroll the screen to the corresponding section.

### About Me
This section shares some information about my past work experience and my interests.

### Work
Currently I am in the early stages of bootcamp so I don't have projects to show off just yet to a potential employeer. In there place, I've linked them to the following places:
- The first project links to the repository to my first homework assignment. This is also the "priority" project. That means, it will be larger then the other project cards <ins>*until the window screen is shrunk to below 768px*</ins>. I did this because generally one doesn't hover over things on a webpage when using a tablet or phone, so this function no longer seemed necessary for those screens.
- The other four project cards link to various Google searches about the specific topic they list, either hockey, dog spots, desserts, and a helmet from Star Wars.

### Footer / Contact Me
The instructor advised us not to use our real phone numbers or emails at this time as it could lead to an increase to junk calls/emails. As a result, I've used fake ones in their place. The GitHub link does go to my actual GitHub however.

### UX Design
- [Example Portfolio](https://nicepage.com/website-templates/preview/web-design-portfolio-262230?device=desktop) - I did not inspect the code of this website, I only looked at it for visual design inspiration. The challenge of getting a circle around my portfolio photo seemed fun.
